### Description

**safe-sparse-array** for android projects because the original [SparseArray](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/SparseArray.html) classes are failing for equals checks.
[See tests](https://github.com/stumi01/safe-sparse-array/tree/master/app/src/test/java/com/stumi/safesparsearray) for proof :)

### User guide
Just replace the usage of `*SparseArray` with `Safe*SparseArray`.
All the classes are extending from the original ones, just mplementing the equals and hashcode methods.

### Integration

The lib is available on https://jitpack.io.

```
repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.stumi01:safe-sparse-array:1.0'
}
```
